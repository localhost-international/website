Well: why not!?\n\n\tIn the late 90s (when I started to gain curiosity into how websites were built),\n\t\"View Source\" was an invaluable tool. These days, with minification and obfuscation \n\tused by bundlers and builders in web frameworks, it's harder than ever for someone starting \n\tout to learn \"how things are made\". Hopefully this will help.\n\n\tThis website can also be viewed without JavaScript (or with a text based web browser).\n\tI'm actively working to improve accessibility for tools such as screen readers (e.g. VoiceOver, et al), \n\tso please let me know if this isn't the case.\n\n\tSpotted a bug or wanted to ask a question?\n\n\t* Visit https://github.com/localhost-international/website/issues\n\t* ...or email: leslie@localhost.international\n\n\tHappy hacking. \n\n\tlocalhost % ".concat("".concat(new Date().getFullYear()), "\n\n-->");
